# openvpn-aws
openvpn-aws is a server that integrates [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net) with AWS. It is designed to be easy and cheap to run
while providing strong security. User VPN keys are registered in IAM, using the Explicit Trusted Key Model. openvpn-aws can be
used today, but it should be regarded as experimental, and more documentation is coming.

For more information about using openvpn-aws, please see the [project website](https://amadigan.github.io/openvpn-aws/).

If you are looking for information about how to build or modify openvpn-aws, see the documentation in the `build` and `ui`
directories.
